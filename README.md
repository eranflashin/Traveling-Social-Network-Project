# Traveling-Social-Network-Project

In this project we have built a frontend and a backend for a mini traveling social network.

The system supports the following features:
  
  - Secured login
  - Registration
  - Posts feed
  - Posts editing, deleting and subscription
  - Adding new post
  - Viewing users' info including followers and followed
  - Users search (with autocompletion)
  - Notification
  - Map search for potential trip partners (by dates, point on map and radius)
